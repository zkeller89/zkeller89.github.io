This is a follow up to [part 1 of this course review series]({% post_url 2022-10-02-dtc-ml-zoomcamp-pt1 %}). If you'd like an overview of the course and why I enrolled as a somewhat seasoned analyst, check out that post.

### TL;DR

1. I liked the 2nd half of the course even more than the first, which I already held in high regard.
2. The second half of this course largely focused on deep-learning and introduced some of the issues/concepts that are important when it comes to deploying a ML model.
    * additional deployment learning can be found (free) in Alexey's [ML Ops Zoomcamp][1].
3. Alexey maintained the "accessible, but not overly-simplistic" model that was emphasized in the first half of the course.
    * He readily admitted that there's __a lot__ more to the theory and techniques behind deep-learning. He recommended the Stanford Course, [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition][2], which looks really helpful and is also free.
4. The additional resources provided by the course in addition to the core content were hugely useful.
    1. Alexey got together a [kaggle competition][3] in conjunction with some of the course sponsors that could optionally be used as a focus for the capstone project. I loved this because one of my least favorite parts of big projects is having to decide what dataset to work with.
    2. For training our deep-learning models, Data Talks Club and [SaturnCloud][4] partnered to ensure all students got 30 hours of free compute time, allowing the students to have GPU resources that didn't take a bite out of your wallet.
