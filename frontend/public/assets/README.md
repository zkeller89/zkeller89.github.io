## Resume

Place your resume PDF file here as `resume.pdf` to make it available for download on your website.

The resume is linked in two places:
1. **Navigation bar** - "Resume" link in the header
2. **About section** - "ðŸ“„ Download Resume" button

Both links point to `/assets/resume.pdf` and will open in a new tab.

## Adding Your Resume

1. Replace the empty `resume.pdf` file with your actual resume
2. Make sure the filename is exactly `resume.pdf` (case-sensitive)
3. The file will be automatically served by React's public folder

## File Requirements

- **Format**: PDF only
- **Filename**: Must be `resume.pdf`
- **Size**: Keep under 5MB for best performance
- **Location**: Must be in `/frontend/public/assets/`
